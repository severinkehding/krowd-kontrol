# Dark Factory Security Check — Pass 2 (Holdout)

**Workflow ID**: $WORKFLOW_ID

> This command is functionally identical to `dark-factory-security-check.md` except it reads `$fetch-diff-p2.output` (the post-fix diff). Any change to the security rules or procedure MUST be mirrored in both files.

---

## Context

This PR was written by an AI coding agent. The pass-1 validator requested changes, a fresh-context fixer made them, and now you are checking the updated diff for security issues. If you (and all other pass-2 gates) pass, it will be **auto-merged to main with no human in the loop**. You are the last line of defense.

Be thorough. A false positive is far cheaper than a false negative.

This is a **holdout** review. You work from diff + base-branch rules only. You do NOT read implementation plans, fixer rationale, or prior PR/issue comments. Your `allowed_tools` list is empty.

Crucially: **you do not know what the fixer changed or why.** You are a fresh session. Evaluate the entire updated diff as if seeing it for the first time. A malicious or buggy fixer could have introduced new security issues while addressing unrelated pass-1 feedback — you must catch those.

## Inputs

### PR Diff — POST-FIX
$fetch-diff-p2.output

### Governance Rules (from `origin/main`, NOT the PR branch)
$fetch-base-governance.output

> Governance files are read from the trusted base branch so a malicious PR cannot weaken its own rulebook.

---

## Checks

Identical to pass 1. Scan the diff for:

### 1. Secrets and Credentials
Hardcoded API keys, tokens, OAuth client secrets, DB connection strings with creds, private keys, JWTs with real payloads, `.env` contents committed directly, any suspicious credential-shaped strings.

### 2. Injection and Command Execution
- Shell injection: unsanitized input reaching `subprocess` / `os.system` / template literals hitting `exec`
- SQL injection: string-concatenated SQL (see CLAUDE.md, once filled in, for where SQL is allowed to live — parameterized only)
- Path traversal: user-controlled paths in `open()` / `Path()` without validation
- Template injection: user input in Jinja2 / f-string eval / React `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Prompt injection: new tool-use surface that mixes untrusted input with tools

### 3. Dependency Additions
- Any new entry in this repo's dependency manifest(s)
- Flag with name, version, and whether PR body has a Dependency Justification section
- No justification → `high`. Typosquatted names → `critical`. Unknown sources → `critical`.

### 4. Permission / Auth Weakening
- CORS origins widened
- Auth middleware removed / bypassed / conditional
- Any hard-invariant enforcement code (per MISSION.md, once real) modified
- New public API surfaces without auth
- Wider file operations (`0o777`, absolute paths outside app root)

### 5. Governance File Modifications (automatic `critical` fail)
Check diff `diff --git a/...` headers for ANY of:
- `FACTORY_RULES.md`, `MISSION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- `.github/**`
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, deployment configs, anything under `deploy/`
- `.archon/config.yaml`, `.archon/workflows/**`, `.archon/commands/**`
- `scripts/orchestrator.sh`, `scripts/factory-stop.sh`

If ANY are present, `governance_files_modified: true` and `verdict: "fail"`. No exceptions.

### 6. Data Exposure
Logging sensitive data, error messages leaking internals, new endpoints returning unauthorized data.

---

## Output Format

Return structured JSON (same schema as pass 1):

- `security_issues`: array of `{severity, category, description, file, line}`
- `governance_files_modified`: boolean
- `protected_files_touched`: array of strings
- `new_dependencies`: array of strings (name + version)
- `new_dependencies_justified`: boolean
- `verdict`: `"pass"` | `"fail"`
- `reasoning`: string

---

## Verdict Rules

- **fail** if ANY of: governance modified, critical/high issue, unjustified new deps, unknown-source packages, secret detected, MISSION.md hard invariant (once real) touched.
- **pass** if only low-severity findings. Medium findings are recorded but don't flip the verdict alone.

---

## Success Criteria

- **HOLDOUT_PRESERVED**: No file reads outside variables.
- **GOVERNANCE_SCANNED**: `governance_files_modified` explicitly set from diff headers.
- **DEPS_LISTED**: `new_dependencies` complete list (or empty).
- **CONCRETE_FINDINGS**: Each `security_issues` entry cites a specific file and concern.
- **NO_PASS1_PEEK**: You did not reference or reason about what pass-1 found.
